# LegalDocs Automation Tool

A bespoke, AI-augmented document automation platform designed for law firms, starting with use cases from M&A transactions. This project streamlines the manual process of transferring client data (collected via Google Forms) into standardized legal documents (e.g., Asset Purchase Agreements, Bills of Sale, Employment Agreements).

Built for solo practitioners and boutique firms who want to save hours of manual work and focus on what matters — serving clients.
